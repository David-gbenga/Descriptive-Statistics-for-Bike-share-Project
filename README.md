I have worked on a number of projects and one of them is one, I built an interactive and automated reporting system for an automobile leasing company. I showcased my programming and data analytic skills with top notch project management concepts by meeting the project objectives within the given deadline. This company had their presence in many cities in North America with operation data which recorded activities for each day of the week.

In other to generate insights from the companyâ€™s data and maintain a real time reporting system, I achieved the following deliverable using a number tools: Python, Power BI, Mysql, Ms-Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Git bash, Github, Anaconda Command Prompt, Ms-Power Point

Some of the deliverable and highpoints of this project were:

Data gathering: Gathering both structured and unstructured data needed for the project. This was done on a per milestone basis as some milestones in the project required extra datasets which were not initially given
Data Cleaning/mining and modification: A number of Data cleaning operation was carried out to make for anomalies and irregularities in the data. I used a number of pivoting techniques and statistical insights to remove irrelevant rows and columns. Deducing of insights and patterns was necessary to help the company see the peak periods and downtimes of their activities for strategic planning.
Creation of python scripts/modules for statistical analysis: Building an interactive reporting system which works like a chatbot was one of the interesting features of this project. The script prompted the user to input necessary details which in turn outputted desired reports. I created a descriptive statistical system that reported the activities of customers with respect to the following inputted parameters: cities, locations, stations, days, months, year, methods, amount, and volume.
The insights generated from this project were used as fundamental indicators and parameters for profitable logistic and business planning.
